Proud to be a speaker this year at [THE FUTURE OF PRIVATE BANKING ][0] (http://www.privatebanker.lu/). After last year being the host and the closing speaker of the private banking summit organised by Fleming Conferences last year in Zurich, I will now speak in Luxembourg at THE biggest event of Private Banking in Luxembourg. 

The topic will be "The effect of disruptive technology on Wealth Management", this will be a panel list discussion moderated by REUTERS. Looking forward and preparing myself in the upcoming days.
